To run the app, first, you need to install the required dependencies. Navigate to the app directory in your terminal and run:

### `yarn install`

This will install all the necessary dependencies listed in your `package.json` file.

Once the installation is complete, you can start the app in the development mode by running:

### `yarn start`

This starts the development server, and you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make any changes to your source files.

If you want to run the app in the production mode, please use the following command:
